    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "### What's the difference between Product Backlog and Prioritization Matrix?",
        "answer": "Product Backlog is the list view—a hierarchical table showing all Epics, Features, and User Stories with full details and inline editing. It's for managing work tactically (assigning, tracking, updating). Prioritization Matrix is the quadrant view—a 2D visual showing items plotted by value vs. effort. It's for making strategic decisions about what to build next. Same data, different perspectives. Switch between them with one click.\n\nMany users also ask: 'What is backlog in product management?' — and the answer is that our platform addresses this through seamless integration.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### How does the automatic ROI scoring work?",
        "answer": "Every work item has two scores: Business Value (0-100) and Effort/Estimate (0-100). The system automatically calculates ROI score = Value ÷ Effort. Higher scores mean better return on investment. For example: 80 value / 20 effort = 4.0 score (high ROI, build first). 20 value / 80 effort = 0.25 score (low ROI, defer or kill). This gives you an objective way to rank your entire backlog by impact per unit of effort.\n\nMany users also ask: 'How to effectively manage a product backlog?' — and the answer is that our platform addresses this through seamless integration.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### What are cutlines and how do they work?",
        "answer": "Cutlines are draggable horizontal and vertical lines on the Prioritization Matrix that define your priority thresholds. For example, you might set Value=60 (horizontal line) and Effort=40 (vertical line). This creates four quadrants: Items above both cutlines are 'Quick Wins' (high priority). Items below both are 'Efficiency Gains' (low priority). Cutlines are saved at the initiative level so everyone on the team sees the same priority policy. You can adjust them anytime to reflect changing business priorities.\n\nMany users also ask: 'What is the 3 5 3 rule in Scrum?' — and the answer is that our platform addresses this through seamless integration.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### Can I use Deliver with Jira, GitHub, or Azure DevOps?",
        "answer": "Yes, Deliver has bi-directional sync with Jira, GitHub Issues, and Azure DevOps work items. Create items in Deliver and push them to your external tool with one click. Update estimates or status in either system and changes propagate automatically. Prioritization scores can sync as custom fields. This lets your developers use their preferred tools while you maintain centralized strategic planning in Deliver.\n\nMany users also ask: 'What is the 20 30 50 rule for prioritizing backlog items?' — and the answer is that our platform addresses this through seamless integration.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### How do I move from the list view to the matrix view?",
        "answer": "Click the 'Quadrant View' tab at the top of the backlog. It's a one-click toggle. Both views show the same data in real-time—there's no export/import or data sync delay. Create and organize work in Product Backlog (list), then switch to Prioritization Matrix to score and prioritize. Return to Product Backlog to sequence sprints based on priorities. You can switch as often as needed.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### What happens when I drag an item on the matrix?",
        "answer": "When you drag an item to a new position on the Prioritization Matrix, the system converts that position to value and effort scores (both on 0-100 scales). It then automatically calculates the ROI score (value ÷ effort) and saves all three scores to the work item. The changes appear immediately in the Product Backlog list view. So dragging an item from the 'Avoidable Risk' quadrant to the 'Quick Win' quadrant updates its value and effort accordingly.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### Can multiple people use the matrix simultaneously?",
        "answer": "Yes, the Prioritization Matrix supports collaborative prioritization. Multiple team members can be in the matrix at the same time. Changes save immediately when you drop an item. However, for best results, we recommend facilitated prioritization sessions where one person (e.g., product manager) drives the matrix while the team discusses and decides together. This prevents conflicts and ensures shared understanding of priority rationale.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### How do I decide what value and effort scores to assign?",
        "answer": "Value (0-100): Score based on business impact—revenue potential, customer satisfaction, strategic importance, risk reduction, etc. Effort (0-100): Score based on development complexity—engineering time, technical risk, dependencies, unknowns. We recommend a team discussion to calibrate scoring. Some teams use reference items: 'This is 20 effort' (1 day) vs. 'That is 80 effort' (2 months). Others use T-shirt sizes mapped to numbers (S=20, M=40, L=60, XL=80). The key is consistency within your team.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### What if I have 500+ items in my backlog? Will the matrix become cluttered?",
        "answer": "Great question. The Prioritization Matrix works best with your top 50-100 items that need active prioritization. Items that haven't been scored yet appear in the 'Unscored Items' panel on the left—you drag them onto the matrix when you're ready to evaluate them. Use filters to show only Epics (strategic view) or only Features you're considering for the next quarter. You don't need to score your entire backlog at once—focus on what's relevant now.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### Can I export the matrix for stakeholder presentations?",
        "answer": "Yes, you can take a screenshot of the matrix for presentations, or export the underlying data (all items with their value, effort, and score) to CSV from the Product Backlog view. Many teams present the matrix in quarterly planning sessions to show stakeholders the strategic landscape: 'Here are our quick wins, here are our strategic bets, here's what we're deferring.' The visual makes priority trade-offs easy to communicate to non-technical audiences.",
