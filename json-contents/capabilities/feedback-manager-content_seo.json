      {
        "question": "### How does duplicate detection work?",
        "answer": "AI-powered natural language matching. When users submit feedback, the system searches existing items and shows similar ones with percentage match scores (e.g., \"78% similar to...\"). Users can vote on existing items instead of creating duplicates. You can also manually merge related items.",

        "answer": "One-click conversion: \"Turn to Epic\", \"Turn to Feature\", \"Turn to User Story\". Or link feedback to existing backlog items. Once connected, the feedback shows the work item ID. If using auto-sync, status updates from roadmap (Planned → In Progress → Shipped) automatically update feedback status.",

        "answer": "Collections group related feedback around themes or problem areas (e.g., \"Mobile Experience\", \"Enterprise Security\"). One feedback item can belong to multiple collections. Collections can have AI-generated problem summaries and linked solutions. Great for organizing feedback by strategic theme.",
