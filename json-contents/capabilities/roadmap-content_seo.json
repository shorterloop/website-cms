      {
        "question": "### How do intervals/timeboxes work?",
        "answer": "You define intervals with start and end dates at the organizational level (e.g., Q1 2025: Jan 1 - Mar 31, Q2 2025: Apr 1 - Jun 30). Product roadmaps inherit these intervals. You can also create hierarchical intervals (e.g., quarters that contain sprints). Intervals are flexible—use whatever timeline structure your organization follows.",

          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### Can we change the roadmap structure mid-year?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Roadmaps are living documents. Add/remove themes, adjust interval dates, move work items between timeboxes—all with drag-and-drop or simple edits. Changes sync in real-time. Your roadmap adapts as your strategy evolves.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### How does this integrate with our backlog?",
        "answer": "The roadmap includes a collapsible backlog panel showing unscheduled (orphan) work items—epics, features, and objectives that aren't yet on the timeline. Drag items from the backlog onto intervals when you're ready to schedule them. Items automatically return to the backlog if removed from intervals.",

        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### What's the difference between roadmap and strategy board?",
        "answer": "Strategy Board is for validating what to build (objectives → opportunities → solutions → experiments). Roadmap is for scheduling when to build it (organizing validated work on a timeline). They integrate: validated strategy items flow into roadmap objectives. Think of Strategy Board as the 'why' and Roadmap as the 'when.'",

      },
      {
        "question": "### Can external stakeholders view our roadmap?",
        "answer": "Yes. You can share roadmap views with stakeholders. Export as PDF or JPEG for presentations. Control what's visible via filters (e.g., show only customer-facing work, hide internal platform items). Share links to specific theme or product roadmap views.",

      {
        "question": "### How many product roadmaps can we have?",
        "answer": "Unlimited. Each product, initiative, or team can have their own roadmap. All product roadmaps can align to the same organizational roadmap and themes. This lets each team plan independently while maintaining strategic alignment.",
