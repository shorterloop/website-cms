    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "### What is a product discovery tool and how does it differ from Google Docs?",
        "answer": "A **product discovery tool** like Discover provides structured canvases (Product Vision, User Personas, Business Model Canvas) specifically designed for product teams, with automatic data syncing between artifacts. Google Docs is generic—you're building everything from scratch with no integration. With Discover, when you define target groups in your Vision, they automatically become Personas. When you research persona pains/gains, they auto-populate your Business Model. This integrated product discovery platform eliminates duplicate data entry and ensures consistency across all discovery artifacts.",

          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### Do I need all three features (Vision, Personas, Business Model)?",
        "answer": "You can use any feature standalone, but the power comes from integration. Most successful teams follow the product discovery process in order: (1) **Product Vision** to align on strategy, (2) **User Personas** for deep customer research using our user persona template, (3) **Business Model Canvas** to validate viability. If you already have a vision, you can start directly with Personas or Business Model. The system still benefits from data syncing—for example, updating a Persona name automatically updates it everywhere.",
        "_formatting": {
          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### How does risk scoring work and why does it matter?",
        "answer": "On Persona cards (jobs, pains, gains, needs), you score two dimensions: **Importance** (1-5: how much this matters to the customer) and **Uncertainty** (1-5: how confident you are in this assumption). Items with high importance AND high uncertainty are automatically flagged for experimentation—these are risky assumptions that could kill your product if wrong. This product validation framework helps you focus validation efforts on what matters most, rather than wasting time testing low-risk items. Many users also ask: 'how to validate product ideas before building' — and the answer is that our platform guides you through continuous product discovery methods with built-in risk assessment.",

          "question": "h3"
        }
      },
      {
        "question": "### Can I export artifacts for stakeholder presentations?",
        "answer": "Yes! Every canvas (Vision, Personas, Business Model) can be exported to **PDF** or **JPEG** with professional formatting. Great for investor decks, executive reviews, team workshops, and product discovery workshop facilitation. Exported files are high-resolution and ready to embed in slide presentations. You can also share live links to canvases for real-time collaboration.",

      },
      {
        "question": "### How does AI assist with the product discovery process?",
        "answer": "AI helps you get started faster by generating content suggestions for vision statements, persona bios, jobs-to-be-done, value propositions, and business model blocks. You provide brief inputs (e.g., target customer description), and AI generates structured content following best product discovery best practices. You then review, edit, and refine the generated content. AI accelerates the process but never replaces human judgment and customer research.",
